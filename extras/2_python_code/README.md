# Documentation
## Aim
The purpose of this library is to be able to process EEG signals in python instead of matlab. The EEG processing relies heavily on the MNE python library, found [here](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python)
## Architecture
- The wpli.py file contains the bulk of the code, which will be discussed later.
- The test.py file contains examples of the use of the functions and structures present in the wpli.py file
## Usage
To use the code, one needs to import the wpli.py file at the beginning of their python file, as follows : 
```python
import "wpli.py"
```
