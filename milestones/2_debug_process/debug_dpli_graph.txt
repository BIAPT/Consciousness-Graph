I compared the values of the matrices until I was sure that allk operations were using the same ones
It seems that the threshold sweep uses the data that still contains the non-scalp electrodes
I hope that filtering before the threshold sweep might fix the problem
It did not fix the problem
I will make sure that the filtered data is the same on both sides
It is the same.
