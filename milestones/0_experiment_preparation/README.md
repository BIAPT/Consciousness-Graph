File to track the interesting datasets from https://openneuro.org/ that could be rele vant to this experiment.
Searching for Datasets containing eeg data of healthy patient in a resting state.



#Initial scan with keyword "eeg" in the searchbox, I don't know if some datasets with eeg data could evade this search, the search feature is not very developed
#Ordered from most interesting to least interesting in my (Raphael Christin) opinion

-RS_TMSEEG_Data at url : https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001849/versions/1.0.2
  Based on the title of the dataset, seems to be resting state EEG data
  more info in this paper : https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31929531/ , will update the details after reading the paper

-EEG meditation study, at url : https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001787/versions/1.0.2
  EEG data of healthy participants meditating, not exactly a resting state dataset.
  24 participants, more info in this paper : https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27815577/ , will update the details after reading the paper
  
-Internal attention study at url : https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002691/versions/1.0.0
  EEG data of participants, there is a relax period of 9 seconds in between tasks, I don't know if this could be useful, I don't think so
  20 subjects, more info in paper : https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Psychophysical-interactions-with-a-single-photon-Radin-Michel/8095890b463b7d373054b9da40a04356cc63bcf2 , will search for details if this dataset proves interesting
  
-DataSet1 at url : https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002791/versions/1.0.0
  the description says no available tasks so maybe this is resting state data??
  23 subjects , in the absemce of more information this doesn't seem like the most promising dataset

-rsfMRI before and after one session EEG NF vs Sham NF, at url :https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001408/versions/1.0.3
  fMri and EEG data of healthy patients in a resting state, fMRI not needed
    52 patients, 22 males, 18-44 yo, right-handed, no neurological or psychiatric disorder history
!!after review, only the fMRI seems to be resting state data so this data would be inappropriate.
