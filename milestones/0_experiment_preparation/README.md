# File to track the interesting datasets from https://openneuro.org/ that could be rele vant to this experiment.
## Searching for Datasets containing eeg data of healthy patient in a resting state.



### Initial scan with keyword "eeg" in the searchbox, I don't know if some datasets with eeg data could evade this search, the search feature is not very developed
#### Ordered from most interesting to least interesting in my (Raphael Christin) opinion

- [RS_TMSEEG_Data][1]  
  Based on the title of the dataset, seems to be resting state EEG data  
  [more info here][2] , will update the details after reading the paper  

- [EEG meditation study][3]  
  EEG data of healthy participants meditating, not exactly a resting state dataset  
  24 participants, [more info here][4] , will update the details after reading the paper  
  
- [Internal attention study][5]  
  EEG data of participants, there is a relax period of 9 seconds in between tasks, I don't know if this could be useful, I don't think so  
  20 subjects, [more info here][6], will search for details if this dataset proves interesting  
  
- [DataSet1][7]  
  the description says no available tasks so maybe this is resting state data??  
  23 subjects , in the absemce of more information this doesn't seem like the most promising dataset  

- [rsfMRI before and after one session EEG NF vs Sham NF][8]  
  fMri and EEG data of healthy patients in a resting state, fMRI not needed  
  52 patients, 22 males, 18-44 yo, right-handed, no neurological or psychiatric disorder history  
  **after review, only the fMRI seems to be resting state data so this data would be inappropriate.**  
  
### Second scan through the whole database, showing all the dataset that eluded the first one
#### Ordered from most interesting to least interesting in my (Raphael Christin) opinion

- [Single-pulse open-loop TMS-EEG dataset][9]  
  20 subjects, includes rest eeg, not much more information but seems to be the most promising dataset  

- [CRYPTO and PROVIDE EEG Baseline Data][10]
  226 subjects, baseline eeg data but it's on young infants, so it doesn't seem that relevant 

- [PROBE iEEG][11]
  raw iEEG data, 6 subjects, says no available tasks so maybe rest, without more information doesn't seem that interesting
