# File to document what I did and did not understand from [Dissociated cortical phase- and amplitude-coupling patterns in the human brain][1]
## What I understood : 
Phase and amplitude coupling are used to sometimes used to gather insights into cortical connections and relationship between different parts of the cortex. However, the relationship
betweeen the two types of coupling is still unclear. Aplitude-coupling is even trickier, because it has been pointed out that some of the measured amplitude-coupling can be due to
the combination ofmphase-coupling and the methods used to measure amplitude-coupling. This paper used MEG to record brain activity in 95 healthy subjects. The resulting data was then
analyzed for phase- and amplitude-coupling. Various mathematical strategies were applied to clean the data. Simulations were made to estimate how much of the amplitude-coupling was due
to phase-coupling and methodology. Phase- and amplitude-coupling patterns were compared to assess whether they conveyed the same information about neuronal processes. The paper found 
that a significant part of the amplitude-coupling signals could not be explained by phase-coupling signals interfering with the methodology, and therefore are likely to be caused by 
genuine amplitude-coupling. Furthermore, they found that phase- and amplitude-coupling patterns were significantly different, indicating that they are at east partly caused by different 
neural mechanism.
